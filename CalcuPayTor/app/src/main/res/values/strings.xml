    <string name="activity_disclaimer">This product is created for the sole purpose of getting an approximation of how much pay you are entitled
     to in a week. It is not guaranteed to be exact.\n
    There are many factors that should be taken into account when using this app. Factors such as:\n\n<b>Order of Operations</b>\n<b>Individual calculation logic that we don\'t account for</b>\n<b>etc.</b>\n\nAre not guaranteed to calculate exactly as your pay slip program would.
    The more complicated a job\'s pay rule set is, the less likely CalcuPayTor is to calculate exactly.
